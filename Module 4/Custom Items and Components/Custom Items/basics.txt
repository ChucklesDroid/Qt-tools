In qml to create reusable components just like in C++ classes, we make use of 'components'
There are 2 ways to make components in QML:-

1) Components
    a) Defined using the component item
    b) As many as need, with a file-unique name
    c) Used as templates for items
    d) Used with models and views
    e) Used with generated content
    f) Can be instantiated dynamically

2) Custom items 
    a) Defined in seperate files
    b) One main element per file
    c) Used in the same way as standard items
    d) Can have assosciated version number
    e) The file must start with a Capital Letter

Adding Custom Properties: 

Syntax: [readonly] <type> <name> [: <value>]

Examples: 
    property string product: "QtQuick"
    property int count: 123
    property real slope: 123.456
    property bool condition: true
    property url address: "http://qt.io/"
    readonly property int area: height*width
