'MouseArea' only responds to 'acceptedButtons'. To specify that MouseArea will respond to multiple buttons we use '|' together with the values.
Eg: -
MouseArea{
    acceptedButtons: Qt.leftButton | Qt.rightButton
}
The handlers are not called for any other buttons but any click involving the 'allowedButtons' is reported.


'containsMouse' is the property that holds wether the mouse is currently inside the 'MouseArea'.
With 'hoverEnabled' to false, 'containsMouse' will only be valid when the mouse is pressed and the mouse is 
inside the MouseArea.
