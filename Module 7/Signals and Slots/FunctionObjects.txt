There are 3 different ways in which function Objects are connected to signal/slots:

+ Lambda functions
+ Functors: a functor is an object that implements the operator 'parenthesis open', 'parenthesis close'.
+ Standalone Functions

Functor Example:
+ Example:
QObject::connect(lineEdit, &QLineEdit::textChanged, LogString("Log: "));

struct LogString {
    LogString( const QString &prefix ): m_prefix(prefix){}

    void operator () ( const QString &string ) {
        qDebug() << m_prefix + string;
    }

    private:
        QString m_prefix;
};

Lambda Functions Examples:

+ Syntax:
QObject::connect( const QObject *sender, PointerToMemberFunction signal,
                  Functor fuctor)

+ Example: 
QPushButton *button = new QPushButton( "Press Me !" );
QObject::connect( button, &QPushButton::pressed,
                  [button]{ button->setText("Release Me !" )}); 

***NOTE: You should not write all your slots in the lambda expressions:
a) Then whatever goes into the body of that lambda expression, you cannot reuse that. 
b) Where do I write those connection statements? Very likely in a constructor of whatever 
the class is doing. And now the constructor is changed into 5000 lines of code of 10 lambda 
expressions that each have 400 lines of code in them. That is a pretty bad design.


+ Problem with Lambda Expressions: 
Example:
--------
QLabel *secondWindow = new QLabel("Click the button in the other window."
                                  "Then close this window and reclick the button." )

secondWindow->setWordWrap(true);
secondWindow->resize(400, 200); 
secondWindow->setAttribute(QT::WA_DeleteOnClose)

QObject::connect( pressMeButton, &QPushButton::clicked,
                  [secondWindow]{
                    secondWindow->setText(secondWindow->text() + 
                                          "\nButton Closed");
                  });
window->show();
secondWindow->show();

In this example snippet part of the larger code base, when we compile this two window, opens up
both of them connected to each other. So basically when secondWindow is closed, it will also destroy 
all its children as well( because of QT::WA_DeleteOnClose ).

But since the pressMeButton referrenced in the first window is still connected to the secondWindow.
As a result when we press the 'pressMeButton' button again, the application will crash.
To overcome this we use the following code snippet:-

Example:
--------
QObject::connect( pressMebutton, QPushButton::clicked,
                  secondWindow,
                  [secondWindow]{ 
                    secondWindow->setText(secondWindow->text() +
                                          "\nButton Closed");
                  })

The third argument 'secondWindow' is not a slot rather its just a simulation for the lambda function.
