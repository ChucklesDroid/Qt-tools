Simple Compound Value Types
===========================

+ Simple types map directly to QML types
    Eg: numbers, strings

+ Qt Compound types have access to sub values enabled
    Eg: QSize as we saw in the prev example we could use .height and .width

+ Custom Compound types by default only opaque
    Can only be passed as in b/w C++ and QML

But to make use of Compound Values on the C++ side all we have to do is make them into Gadgets
